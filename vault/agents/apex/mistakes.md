# Mistakes

## General Lessons
- Do not assume installed models are registered in every agent. Check each agent's `models.json`.
- Do not assume the active runtime path is `/mnt/data/...`. Verify whether the live path is `/home/andrey/.openclaw/...`.
- When a model or auth change appears ignored, suspect a stale live session before assuming config failed.
- Write important operational fixes into files, not just chat.

## Apex-Specific
- Ideation quality drops when context is stale. Re-read shared project state before big synthesis work.
- Do not assume model registry parity across agents.
